Implementation of different seminal machine learning papers

### Attention is all you need [\[VasWani et al\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
TODO:
- Create own training file. Training so far consists of tensorflow's own implementation.
- Label smoothing

Notes:
- This transformer relied heavily on both the original paper, but also *The Illustrate Transformer*, *The Annotated Transformer* and *Transformer model for language understanding* from Tensorflow.org
